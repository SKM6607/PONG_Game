ðŸŽ® HOW TO PLAY PONG

OBJECTIVE:
- Keep the ball from passing your paddle.
- Score points when the ball gets past your opponent's paddle.

GAME ELEMENTS:
- Two paddles (one for each player or one player vs computer).
- One ball that bounces off walls and paddles.
- A rectangular playing field (screen or canvas).

CONTROLS:
Player 1 (Left Paddle):
  - W = Move Up
  - S = Move Down

Player 2 (Right Paddle):
  - Up Arrow (â†‘) = Move Up
  - Down Arrow (â†“) = Move Down

RULES:
- The ball starts in the center and moves diagonally.
- It bounces off the top and bottom walls.
- If the ball hits a paddle, it bounces back.
- If the ball passes a paddle, the other player scores.
- First to a set score (e.g. 5 or 10) wins!

TIPS:
- React quickly to the ball's direction.
- Try to hit the ball with the edge of your paddle to change its angle.
- Practice to improve your reflexes!
